# Weather Dashboard

Weather dashboard application using JS, Jquery and a weather api

## Description

This application is a browser weather application which allows the user to input a location such as a city, e.g. "London" and the application will make a call to the openweathermap api in order to show the weather forecast for this location.

This is useful as it prevents the need to actually visit an external site, we are able to show this data within our own website and if we wanted to expand on this we would be able to provide the user with information from various different apis while still keeping the user on our website so they do not need to be redirected away from our site. This is especially ideal for businesses who want to keep the interest of the user and want to maintain their focus for a longer period of time.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use the weather application, you must simply open the deployed application within the browser.

Entering the name of a city and pressing the search button should mean the application will make an api call, and the relevant weather forecast data will then be displayed in a visual format within the browser for the user to see.
